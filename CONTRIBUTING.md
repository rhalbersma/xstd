# Contributing to xstd

## Workflow

When adding or changing a public utility:

1. Add or update the relevant header under `include/xstd/`.
2. Add or update matching tests under `test/src/`; CMake creates one test executable per `.cpp` file in that directory.
3. Build and test locally (see below).
4. Update the feature table and examples in [README.md](README.md) when the public API changes.

## What a PR must satisfy before it can merge

This repository enforces its quality bar through CI rather than through review discretion. A PR is mergeable once every required check below is green; none of these are aspirational:

- **Every compiler/platform leg passes.** See the table in [README.md](README.md) for the current matrix (GCC, Clang, Clang-CL, MSVC, MinGW, Apple Clang). Every leg is required, including every `Trunk / Preview` leg (`17-SVN`, `23-SVN`, `2026-Preview`) and the `libc++` leg: xstd tracks trunk deliberately and none of these are advisory.
- **`clang-tidy` is clean.** The [Clang-Tidy workflow](.github/workflows/clang-tidy.yml) runs the checks in [`.clang-tidy`](.clang-tidy) with `WarningsAsErrors: '*'` over the public headers, so any finding fails the job outright - there is no "advisory, fix later" mode.
- **Line and branch coverage stay at 100%, project-wide and for the PR's own diff.** [`codecov.yml`](.github/codecov.yml) sets both the `project` and `patch` Codecov status checks to a 100% target with zero tolerance, backed by the [Coverage workflow](.github/workflows/coverage.yml)'s own `gcovr --fail-under-line 100 --fail-under-branch 100` gate. New code needs a test that exercises every line and branch it adds; existing coverage may not regress. Excluded from this bar: `assert(...)` contract checks (their failure path is undefined behavior by design, not something a correct test can hit), compiler-synthesized `= default;` special members (gcov cannot attribute a hit counter to them regardless of how often they run), and the exception-unwinding branch gcc/gcov attaches to any call that could throw (`--exclude-throw-branches`/`--exclude-unreachable-branches`) - not a code path a test can meaningfully hit either.
- **No new sanitizer failures.** The [sanitizers workflow](.github/workflows/sanitizers.yml) must stay green.
- **The public headers stay self-sufficient.** Each header is compiled as its own translation unit (see `test/CMakeLists.txt`); don't rely on include order from another header.
- **`clang-format` is clean.** The [Clang-Format workflow](.github/workflows/clang-format.yml) runs `clang-format --dry-run --Werror` over every header and test source against [`.clang-format`](.clang-format), so any diff fails the job. Run `clang-format -i` on changed files before pushing. A few spots that clang-format can't express (hand-laid-out test-data tables, one constrained-template constructor) are wrapped in `// clang-format off` / `// clang-format on`; don't add new guards without a comparable reason.
- **Workflow files pass `actionlint`.** The [Actionlint workflow](.github/workflows/actionlint.yml) validates GitHub Actions syntax and expressions.
- **The documented consumption methods work.** The [Consumption workflow](.github/workflows/consumption.yml) builds a consumer using `find_package`, `add_subdirectory`, and `FetchContent`.
- **CodeQL analysis is clean.** The [CodeQL workflow](.github/workflows/codeql.yml) runs the C/C++ `security-extended` query suite.

Match the surrounding code's style by eye where `.clang-format` doesn't have an opinion, including the Boost Software License header comment at the top of every source and workflow file.

## Building and testing locally

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Or with the checked-in CMake presets, which pick up Boost.Test from a `VCPKG_ROOT`-configured vcpkg toolchain:

```sh
cmake --preset dev-vcpkg
cmake --build --preset dev-vcpkg
ctest --preset dev-vcpkg
```

### Reproducing the coverage gate

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="--coverage -O0 -g" -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="--coverage"
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
gcovr --root . --exclude 'test/.*' --exclude 'build/.*' \
  --exclude-lines-by-pattern '^\s*assert\(' \
  --exclude-lines-by-pattern '=\s*default;' \
  --exclude-branches-by-pattern '^\s*assert\(' \
  --exclude-branches-by-pattern '^\s*.*=\s*default;' \
  --exclude-throw-branches --exclude-unreachable-branches \
  --print-summary --fail-under-line 100 --fail-under-branch 100
```

### Reproducing the clang-tidy gate

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
run-clang-tidy -quiet -p build "$PWD/build/test/header_self_sufficiency/.*"
```
