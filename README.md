xstd is a collection of small, portable, header-only standard-library
extensions. It relies on the [C++23](https://wg21.link/N4950) standard and targets the
draft [C++29](https://wg21.link/std) standard library. All public APIs
are in namespace `xstd`.

## Requirements

- A conforming [C++23](https://wg21.link/N4950) compiler
- CMake 3.28 or later when using the supplied CMake project
- No third-party runtime or library dependencies outside `<xstd/ext/>`

`<xstd/ints/format.hpp>` is the only header that depends on `<format>`. The
`<xstd/ext/>` headers are the only ones that include a third-party library, and
no other header includes them: an adapted library is reached by naming it.

## Add xstd-ints to a project

The usual approach is CMake's `FetchContent`:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    xstd-ints
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/rhalbersma/xstd-ints.git
    GIT_TAG main # Prefer a release tag for reproducible builds.
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(xstd-ints)

target_link_libraries(my_target PRIVATE xstd::ints)
```

`find_package(xstd-ints CONFIG REQUIRED)` and `add_subdirectory(external/xstd-ints)` provide
the same `xstd::ints` target.

The native bit-precise aliases are available when the compiler defines
`__BITINT_MAXWIDTH__`; `XSTD_HAS_BIT_INT` detects their public API. Their current
minimum width is two so every exposed type has a signed or unsigned counterpart.
The 128-bit aliases and their `make_signed` and `make_unsigned` associations are
defined together in `<xstd/ints/cstdint/int128.hpp>`; `<xstd/ints/cstdint.hpp>` is their
umbrella. The two `<xstd/ext/>` umbrellas export `<xstd/ints/ext/absl/int128.hpp>` and
`<xstd/ints/ext/boost/int128.hpp>`, and each needs the library it adapts on the
include path; nothing above them exports either. Each adapted header is
exported in turn, so including one is enough: `<xstd/ints/ext/absl/int128.hpp>`
brings `absl::int128` and `absl::uint128` with it.

If you lint with `clang-tidy` and use any Boost library, `misc-include-cleaner`
will report that nothing provides the Boost names you write, here and anywhere
else you use Boost: no Boost library ships the IWYU pragmas the check reads, and
its public headers reach their declarations through private implementation ones.
The answer is one line in your own `.clang-tidy`, which no library can supply for
you:

```yaml
CheckOptions:
  misc-include-cleaner.IgnoreHeaders: 'boost/.*'
```

## Examples

```cpp
#include <climits>
#include <xstd/ints/cstdlib.hpp>
#include <xstd/ints/memory.hpp>

static_assert(xstd::unsigned_abs(INT_MIN) == static_cast<unsigned>(INT_MAX) + 1u);
static_assert(xstd::align_up(100uz, 64) == 128);
static_assert(xstd::align_down(100uz, 64) == 64);

constexpr auto result = xstd::div_euclid(-8, 3);
static_assert(result.quotient == -3);
static_assert(result.remainder == 1);
```

The numeric concepts, limits, and traits extend their standard counterparts to
integer-class types, including native bit-precise integers and the portable
128-bit aliases:

```cpp
#include <xstd/ints/concepts/signed_integer.hpp>
#include <xstd/ints/concepts/unsigned_integer.hpp>
#include <xstd/ints/cstdint.hpp>
#include <xstd/ints/limits.hpp>

static_assert(xstd::signed_integer<xstd::int128>);
static_assert(xstd::unsigned_integer<xstd::uint128>);

#ifdef XSTD_HAS_BIT_INT
static_assert(xstd::signed_integer<xstd::bit_int<24>>);
static_assert(xstd::numeric_limits<xstd::bit_uint<24>>::digits == 24);
#endif
```

Use `XSTD_NO_UNIQUE_ADDRESS` inside an attribute-specifier. It expands to
`msvc::no_unique_address` with the MSVC-compatible frontend and to
`no_unique_address` elsewhere:

```cpp
#include <xstd/misc/type_traits/no_unique_address.hpp>

struct storage {
    [[XSTD_NO_UNIQUE_ADDRESS]] allocator_type allocator;
    value_type value;
};
```

The `integer` concept and its signedness refinements are cv-transparent. The
integer functions return the argument type rather than a promoted one. Following
[P3701R0](https://wg21.link/P3701R0), `bool` and the five character types
`char`, `wchar_t`, `char8_t`, `char16_t`, and `char32_t` are excluded. `signed
char` and `unsigned char` remain integers, preserving exact-width 8-bit aliases.
Nothing is excluded by name: `integer_class` admits the built-in integers, so
`integer` is defined over it plus the signedness behaviour every integer has and
no character type does. An integer is one of its own signed/unsigned pair, and
its two transformations compose back; a character type is a third type beside
its pair, `make_signed_t<char>` being `signed char`. `bool` never reaches the
question, C++17 having removed the `++` that `integer_class` asks for. xstd
extends the paper's built-in boundary with paired `integer_class` types.
Character conversion delegates the standard integral domain directly to
`std::to_chars`.

`div_result` is the common quotient/remainder result for truncating `div`,
Euclidean `div_euclid`, and floored `div_floor`. Their vocabulary and relevant
rounding semantics follow [P3724R4](https://wg21.link/P3724R4), but xstd
intentionally implements only this established three-operation family.
A `div_result` renders as `(quotient, remainder)` for every element type it accepts, but which
format specs it accepts depends on that type: where the standard library can
format a tuple of it the tuple grammar applies, and otherwise a string one.

See [the design notes](doc/design.md) for rationale and for customizing an
integer-class type, and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to build the library itself.

## Continuous integration
